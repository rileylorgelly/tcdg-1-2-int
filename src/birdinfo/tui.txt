Tūī¦The Tūī is a medium-sized bird known for its shimmering blue-green feathers and distinctive white throat tufts. It has a curved black beak and a unique dual voice box that allows it to create a wide range of sounds, from melodic whistles to clicks and mimicry of other birds. Tūī feed mainly on nectar from native plants like flax and kowhai, but also eat fruit and insects. Their brush-tipped tongues make them expert nectar-feeders, and they’re often seen darting between flowers or chasing each other in fast, acrobatic flights. Common in forests, parks, and gardens, the Tūī is both visually striking and unmistakably vocal.
