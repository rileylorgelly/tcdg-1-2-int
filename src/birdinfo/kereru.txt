Kererū¦The kererū is a large, eye-catching pigeon with iridescent green and purple feathers, a bright white belly, and a plump, heavy body. It can grow up to 51 cm long and weigh around 650 grams, making it one of the heaviest pigeons. Known for its loud, whooshing wingbeats, the kererū is often heard before it’s seen as it flies through the forest canopy. It has a slow and deliberate flight style and is commonly spotted alone or in pairs. The kererū feeds mostly on fruit, leaves, and flowers, playing a key role in seed dispersal due to its ability to swallow large berries whole.
