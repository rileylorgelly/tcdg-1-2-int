Kiwi¦The kiwi is a small, round, flightless bird with brown, shaggy feathers that resemble fur. Its long, slender beak has nostrils at the tip, allowing it to sniff out insects and worms hidden underground—an unusual trait among birds. Kiwis are nocturnal, shy, and known for their strong legs and silent movement through dense underbrush. Despite their small size, they lay one of the largest eggs in proportion to body size of any bird species.
